        <h2>The Difference</h2>
        <p>
          "The difference between my course and others is in the quality and depth of information covered. Many real estate investor training programs are nothing more than an appetizer designed to get you to buy something more expensive later on. My course gives you the meat and potatoes - Real information taken from over a decade of my own personal and professional experience as an investor, real estate Broker, property manager, and hard money lender. My goal is to provide you with a highly-detailed training program that can help you save time, money, headaches and stress by showing you exactly how to avoid many of the common mistakes investors make and solve real-world problems that will come up."
